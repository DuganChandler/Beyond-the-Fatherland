<align=center><b> Introduction </b></align>
Zorenthra is a vast continent with a multitude of biomes and people. From the mountains of northern Patria to the large and lush forests of Arboryn, Zorenthra sees no lack in ancient terrain. However, despite this vast continent and the even vaster timeline of civilizations and people, the people of Zorenthra have largely remained separated from its past. Ruins from times of old have been scattered across the continent, and yet Zorenthrians see no reason to engage in it due to this large separation. That is, until the golems started to wake up.

<align=center><b> What is Known </b></align>
A decade ago, the first golem woke up in a crypt not far from a small town called Argen in the former nation of Sechosal (now a province of the Patria empire). The town of Argen is situated in a small valley between the Hatlan Hills. In this crypt, one of the ceramic golems emerged. Not much is known about the golems now, even ten years later. Due to the remoteness of Argen, the rest of the world did not know about the golems until a few years after, right before the Patria government took Sechosal. What we do know is that since that first documented awakening, there have been more across Zorenthra, with the only common thread being that all of these golems date back to the Dorah period.

<align=center><b> What is Known </b></align>
There are six ages of the known history of Zorenthra. Many of the Ages are not well documented in historical writing, such as the First through the Fourth. However, after much study and a rise in Patrian scholarship to understand the past, we can understand a bit more about Zorenthra and its timeline:
1. <indent=5%> The First Age - The Dorah Age </indent>
<indent=10%> - Not much is known about the people of the Dorah Age, other than the recognition that their technology was very powerful. Their use of cosmalt and runes are far superior to anything newer civilizations have built, and it is common knowledge across Zorenthra that using Dorah cosmalt tools are far superior to using what is made now. </indent>
2. <indent=5%> The Second Age - The Freeham Age </indent>
<indent=10%> - The Second Age that followed the Dorah Age was short-lived. It is speculated that there was a great collapse of the Dorahee civilization which is why the Second Age is so barren. Archaeological findings of the second age are typically only found in historical Patria, where they have found crudely constructed ceramics that clearly take influence from Dorahee ceramics, but are clearly inferior and replicated. </indent>
3. <indent=5%> The Third Age - The Age of Reconstruction </indent>
<indent=10%> - The third age is an era of reconstruction for Zorenthra. It is during this era that we begin to see the reconstructions of civilizations reminiscent of the Dorah Age. At this point, settlers move across Zorenthra and gather in large ruins from the Dorah Age and rebuild these ruins into cities of the third age. </indent>
4. <indent=5%> The Fourth Age - The Putrid Age </indent>
<indent=10%> - Despite all the work that went into the Age of Reconstruction, the Putrid Age was hit by many devastations. The Putrid Age is known for the conflicts between these individual cities of Reconstruction and a fungal disease that killed thousands of Zorenthrians. </indent>
5. <indent=5%> The Fith Age - The Age of Nations</indent>
<indent=10%> - The Age of Nations is the aftermath of the Putrid Age. City conflicts either resulted in becoming part of nations or returned to ruins once more. The Age of Nations began with the introduction of the cure for the Blight (name of the fungal disease) and the formation of Zorenthra’s first nations. Since the Age of Nations is when Zorenthra began to see more consistent stability and experience a more complex political landscape, there is much documented from The Age of Nations. </indent>
6. <indent=5%> The Sixth Age </indent>
<indent=10%> - The Sixth Age is our current age in Zorenthra. There is debate on whether we are still in the sixth age or if we have progressed to the seventh due to the awakening of the golems. However, for the sake of consistency–and because it is simply too early to tell–I will continue to recognize our current time as the Sixth Age. The Sixth Age is an age of stability, with nations having stayed consistent and technological advances seeing better progress than previous ages (though still not comparable to the Dorah Age). However, there are certain rising concerns about the Sixth Age, such as the rise in national militarization across the Nations of Zorenthra, Patria being the shining example of this. </indent>
While there is much to write about each Age as time goes on, this pamphlet is meant to discuss the Dorahee people of the Dorah Age, and so we will begin our discussion.

<align=center><b> Dorah Technology </b></align>
Dorahee technology is recognized as being far superior to any technology made after their collapse. Dorahee technology was able to harness cosmalt–a mineral that contains magical properties–in ways that are seemingly unattainable nowadays. When examining crypts and ruins where ceramic golems awaken, walls are covered in runic symbols and carefully placed cosmalt veins. Nowadays, if a site is not protected, looters will go and chip off some of the cosmalt and sell it illegally. The Dorahee had built vast travel systems across Zorenthra, which are recognized by large ceramic arches in multiple ruins, with these ceramic structures imbued with cosmalt veins that connect different runes together. However, while modern scientists have tried to replicate the usage of Dorahee technology and try to create a replica of these arches, they face the same issue as The Freeham Age: inferiority.
What we can possibly infer is that Dorahee culture and science emphasized an understanding of the connection between cosmalt and magic itself. The belief that the magic was not a rule breaker of reality, but an enforcer of reality.
