<align=center><b> Arboryn History </b></align>
We’re touring the town today, guided by the mayor’s assistant. It means less time for training, but the diplomacy training equals out the needed growth in physical skills for today.
Part of the discussion will fall to the Ruins, explaining how the monsters first appeared, what they mean for the people, and more. The way history grabs Dad, he would love to learn about this if he was willing to pick up his head and listen to anyone other than his trusted advisors.
In preparation, I took some time to explore the town’s library, finding a book regarding the history of the adjoining Ruins. It took a rhythm to navigate the intermingling of the two, something that clearly hasn’t yet been reached, but I can’t help but trace the words of the page, the start of this process stretching down through the words.
In a sense, Arboryn and the Ruins are reforming their identities to change and accommodate each other. A new aspect of self carves its way into the old. The aspects brush against each other, questioning each time if it rubs the right or wrong way. If I can work this same rhythm into myself, I want to. I want to understand how to merge your separate selves into one.

<align=center><b> Norbert </b></align>
Norbert’s expression changed when we got to Arboryn.
In Patria, dark circles always hung heavy under his eyes, brow furrowed like he found a question he couldn’t answer. When we met, I attributed it to the stress of the military and confronting their lies.
That answer doesn’t sit right with me now.
In Arboryn, seeing the kids of the village run around, his entire demeanor brightened.
Norbert once tried to tackle a tigermoose, so I never saw him as extremely serious. What I considered happiness in that spontaneous moment, I might now call carelessness. 
When he retrieved the ball that had rolled past the treeline into monster territory for that group of kids, he smiled when passing it to them. I could see a weight that I never even processed ease off his shoulders.
As we fight the creatures terrorizing these people, I can now see that same weight roll from his shoulders down into a shield: a cause to put his effort into.
Maybe something about Arboryn sparks these changes, but something tells me this would hold true in other villages as well.
His Patrian enlistment papers had duty listed under cause of enrollment. 
He spots flaws in my tactics I wouldn’t even think of and executes plans without hesitation. Those traits could assist him anywhere, but he chose to be here.
A cause and purpose are synonyms, something separate from duty alone. Duty spawns from a purpose.
Tonight, I overheard Norbert planning how to get his family out of Patria.
He only mentions them occasionally, making off-handed comments regarding how he misses his mother’s cooking or his little brother’s antics.
Even when he doesn’t mention them, the emotion remains, whether in the circles under his eyes or the weight on his shoulders.
Duty has purpose, and his purpose is to protect them. 
Part of me wants to question him about it, but the words go dry on my tongue.
His family wants to leave, and he can’t return to get them out. I have the privilege to return to Patria to speak with a family that would never join me.
Either way, I overheard him mentioning the tang of rhubarb from pies that he missed back home. Perhaps I should try my hand at making one.

<align=center><b> Patria/Renivar Impatience</b></align>
The mayor had to cancel our tour to deal with town members flooding their office. As the people brushed by us, trying to speak to him, their eyes colored with panic as whispered stress flickers between each group.
The panic jumped like flames into my chest as well, and for good reason.
Patria announced their immediate refusal and removal of Arboryan refugees from their land. This will go into effect in the next few days and swathes of people will lose their homes, families, and the lives they built away from the dangers that we’re working to remove in Arboryn.
It was a plan announced by Renivar’s father, making the situation levels worse. The Arboryan people that passed us flinched away when seeing our faces because of that connection, but specifically, because Renivar refuses to mess with that connection in fear it might break.
I’d like to say I understand him. My family has its own issues for its effects on our world and surrounding neighbors, but I at least will scold and reprimand their actions. I speak about their actions and my hatred of them, yet Renivar can only focus on the good he puts out into the world.
He doesn't see how no matter the good you do, the harm of your family follows you. He can’t brush it to the wayside without acknowledgement as much as I can’t do the same. I’ll speak to the mayor soon to see if we can help navigate this influx of people and I’ll speak to Renivar if he allows any kind of open conversation about this.
