<align=center><b> Folkstory told to children to keep them out of the Sechosal Jungle </b></align>
A girl by the name Resenya lived in a small village not far from the jungle.
When she was only ten, she ventured in.
The jungle was vast and dense, but Resenya was determined to explore.
And explore she did.
Now deeper in the jungle, a small clearing holds life.
A creature with long legs and large horns, teeth so sharp and long.
Barely a few days old, the tigermoose sits and waits for its mother.
But she does not return.
Resenya has been exploring the jungle for a few hours now.
She travels deeper, careful to remember her steps.
While she may not realize it, the jungle guides her.
It guides her straight to that clearing.
The tigermoose hears a rustle of leaves.
It turns its head, hoping for its mother.
But instead sees a girl.
A human.
Resenya freezes when she sees the tigermoose.
She has heard stories of their grand size.
But this one is but a baby.
And it seems to have been waiting for a while now.
The tigermoose does not understand anything but to stay put and wait.
Tigermooses in their youth are meant to wait for their mother to return, even when it has been long.
So when there is a human girl, despite the fear, the tigermoose must stay.
But it is so hungry.
Resenya does not relize that even though a tigermoose will continue to wait for its mother, it will not wait to eat.
And poor Resenya, traveling too far, was not the first.
The great tigermoose has a mother, the jungle.
And a mother will make sure her child eats.
