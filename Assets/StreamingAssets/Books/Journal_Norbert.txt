It’s been only a week since I left the place I called home for the boring countryside of Mossmere. Mossmere, of all places! The common folk were petrified at the sight of our armor, and they wouldn’t let us leave until we’ve killed some metal monster. I don’t see the issue; it can’t be that hard. Well, it might be a bit of a challenge because Renivar made us walk for hours without food, and I haven’t seen a good piece of bread in days! I miss my mother's homemade pies; she’d send them to me all the time during my training in Patria. It’s neither sweet nor fitting that I die for my former home. I was young and stupid when they recruited me. They told me that I would be fighting to protect our land and our people, not killing our allies ruthlessly like some kind of rabid creature! King Ehrenfeld has some screws loose, attacking this place. I only hope my family manages to escape the chaos of Patria…

Life in Mossmere might be growing on me after all. Thank God the people here are kind enough to feed us well after we kill off one of their problems. The more monsters we kill, the more well the people treat us, as it seems. Revinar and Lucera don’t seem to mind, but I feel worried about this. Unfortunately, the food they can provide is a meager pittance compared to what we used to have back in Patria. I do pride the people here for making good use of whatever’s left. Back in Patria, we were told that if God knows what King Ehrenfelid is planning to do to this place as I speak.
