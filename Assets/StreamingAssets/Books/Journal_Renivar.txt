<align=center><b> Lucera and Norbert </b></align>
You know, it’s funny how Lucera thinks it’s so easy to just change an entire nation by talking to someone who is basically a stranger. I mean, has she even tried talking through her means before getting onto me? I know she was in the military and has connections.
Thank goodness at least Norbert could step in and guide the conversation or else I might’ve ripped her head off. Not actually. But I was really feeling like it at the moment.
I don’t know how to fix this.
Lucera seems ten seconds away from snapping at me at all times. Even Norbert only sticks with me because I was one of the first friends he made. I don’t know how I’m supposed to solve all these problems that other people made, why it’s on my back.
I’m gonna do it. I have to because it’s wrong if I don’t. But it shouldn’t be this way.
Maybe somehow, something will stop the fighting and we can just breathe, but I doubt that’ll happen any time soon.

It’s a nice thought, though.

I got to speak with the mayor again over food. I definitely prefer when we’re able to have casual conversations rather than those in front of a councilor’s board room, the action live for everyone else.
Speaking over food allows a personal aspect, especially when paired with eating inside the mayor’s office on couches.
It was interesting to hear about the monster struggles behind closed doors. The stories that the mayor told would explain why the town has been so jumpy.
Obviously, that’s not the only reason.
Sometimes the townsfolk flinch when they see my face, probably the familiarity with my features that I’d rather not be there. I could tell the mayor was bouncing around that point of discussion while we were talking.
I don’t blame him. I’d rather not discuss my father either.
But after discussing the monster problem, I feel a little less bad about attacking them. I mean, they’re trying to live their lives, but it’s coming at the cost of harming an entire town. Something has to be done about the situation, so I guess I’ll do all I can to help.

The ten year anniversary of my mother’s passing is in four days, and I don’t know how to feel.
She wasn’t around for all of my hardest moments. I can barely remember what her face looks like since dad got the housekeepers to remove all photos of her.
I understand why.
The divorce was only the first wave of grief; they couldn’t even finish filing the papers before she’d passed away.
And now it’s been nearly a decade and I only know her in the parts dad hates of me.
The only one who encouraged me was Swordskeep, and he’s still back at the Capitol, unquestioning id all my dad has accomplished, if accomplished is even the right word.
I wonder if he’s doing alright as the tensions skyrocket, if he's having to train any more people who wish they could be anywhere but in Patria.
After all, that’s the reason most people here even agree to play along with our nation’s militaristic ideas. It’s the only way to survive. It’s a way to get out by burying yourself further in the system.
I just wish I had seen it earlier.
